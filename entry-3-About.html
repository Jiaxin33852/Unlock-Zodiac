            <p>The concept of twelve constellations originated from the ancient Babylonian Kingdom, one of the four ancient civilizations. At that time, people divided the stars in the sky into many regions, and each region was named by the name of the constellation. I am always interested in this concept because its origin is so ancient and there are lots of stories about each zodiac. </p>
            <p>In today's society, constellation culture is very popular among people. On the one hand, the constellation not only represents the trajectory of the sun in the sky, on the other hand, it also represents a person's date of birth and personality characteristics. I believe that each person's birth time is different, the corresponding position of the planet is also different, so each person's personality and fate will also change. Through the horoscope, you can see the future of love and friendship, you can understand your own personality, and even help you calculate the right constellation to make friends with people. </p>
            <p>Through this website, I hope people can get to know some concepts, ideas and basic knowledge about the zodiac culture. Also, I would like to share my interest with the class in the culture and the meaning behind different zodiac. </p>
