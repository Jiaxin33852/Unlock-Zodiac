            <p>In astrology, Water signs are one of the four elemental categories into which zodiac signs are grouped. Water signs are characterized by their emotional depth, intuition, and sensitivity. The others are Fire, Earth, and Air. Each element contains three signs, and for Water, these are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. Here’s a brief introduction to each Water sign</p>

                <p>Cancers are deeply intuitive and sentimental. They are extremely loyal to loved ones and can exhibit a fierce protective streak. Because of their empathetic nature, they often take on the role of caregiver. They are also quite imaginative and have a strong sense of home and family. Due to their connection with the Moon, which rules emotions, Cancers can experience fluctuating moods and a strong need for emotional security. </p>

            <!-- Image for Scorpio -->
            <div class="section-box">
                <img src="../img/signs/Scorpio.png" class="zodiac-image">
                <p>Scorpios are renowned for their intensity and their ability to see through superficiality. They are fiercely independent and often seek truth no matter what the cost. Their tenacious willpower can make them excellent leaders。 Scorpio’s association with the eighth house in astrology links them to transformation and the mysteries of life, including birth, death, and sexuality. </p>

            <!-- Image for Pisces -->
            <div class="section-box">
                <img src="../img/signs/Pisces.png" class="zodiac-image">
                <p>Pisces are the artists and dreamers of the zodiac. They are compassionate and charitable, often putting others' needs before their own. They are also known for their wisdom and have a philosophical side to their personality. As the last sign of the zodiac, Pisces are thought to have absorbed every lesson from all of the other signs, granting them an old soul wisdom.</p>

            <p>Water signs are typically associated with emotional depth and intuition. They can be mysterious and complex, with rich inner lives. In relationships, they are caring and responsive, often sensing what others need before it is verbally communicated. They tend to seek deep emotional connections and can be quite nurturing.</p>
