            <p>In astrology, Fire and Water signs are considered quite different, with distinct traits that can both clash and complement each other in various aspects of life.</p>
            <p>
                Fire Signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) are known for their passion, creativity, and enthusiasm. They tend to be bold and action-oriented, often exhibiting a zest for life that is contagious. Fire signs are driven by a desire to express themselves and to take charge of situations.
            </p>
            <p>   
                Water Signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces), on the other hand, are characterized by their emotional depth, intuition, and sensitivity. They are often reflective and private, possessing a rich, inner life. Water signs seek deep connections with others and are more nurturing and empathetic.</p>

                <p>When it comes to relationships, Fire and Water signs can have an intense and complex dynamic. Fire's warmth can sometimes be too much for Water's cooler, more subdued nature, while Water's emotional depth can dampen Fire's spirited energy. However, if they manage to balance each other, the Fire sign can learn to tap into their emotional side more deeply, while the Water sign can be inspired to act more assertively and with confidence. </p>

                <img src="../img/communication.png" class="zodiac-image">
                <p>In terms of communication, Fire signs' directness may at times overwhelm Water signs, who are more nuanced and sensitive in their expression. Fire signs can benefit from the subtlety and sensitivity of Water signs, while Water signs can learn to express their needs and ideas more openly. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Image for friendship -->
            <div class="section-box">
                <img src="../img/friendship.png" class="zodiac-image">
                <p>In friendships and social settings, Fire signs are typically outgoing and sociable, often becoming the life of the party, while Water signs may prefer intimate gatherings and deep one-on-one conversations. The Fire sign can encourage the Water sign to come out of their shell, and the Water sign can help the Fire sign to appreciate the value of close, personal connections.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Image for Professional-->
            <div class="section-box">
                <img src="../img/professional.png" class="zodiac-image">
                <p>Professionally, Fire signs tend to be dynamic and can take the lead on projects and ideas with great enthusiasm, while Water signs are often the ones who ensure that the emotional well-being of the team is looked after. Together, they can form a balanced team where action is guided by intuition.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This pairing is a dance of opposites, and with mutual respect and understanding, Fire and Water signs can complement each other's weaknesses with their strengths, leading to a powerful and transformative partnership.</p>
