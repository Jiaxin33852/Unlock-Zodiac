            <p>The Earth signs—Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn—share the common traits of being grounded, practical, and steadfast. They are deeply connected to the physical world and are known as the “doers” of the zodiac. Earth signs are the ones you count on to be reliable and down-to-earth, literally and metaphorically. They each have a strong work ethic and a realistic outlook on life which often leads to significant achievements in their personal and professional lives.</p>

                <img src="../img/signs/Taurus.png" class="zodiac-image">
                <p>As the first of the Earth signs, Taurus is all about reward and physical pleasures, often indulging in the sensory experiences life has to offer. These individuals are incredibly loyal, sometimes to a fault, and value consistency in all areas of life. They have a well-earned reputation for being stubborn, but this also means they are incredibly determined and often reliable workers. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Image for Virgo -->
            <div class="section-box">
                <img src="../img/signs/Virgo.png" class="zodiac-image">
                <p>Virgo, the second Earth sign, is the zodiac's meticulous editor, applying a keen eye for detail to every aspect of life. Virgos are often health-conscious and dedicated to a wellness-oriented lifestyle. Their analytical skills are unmatched, and they apply their sharp intellect to improve every situation. They often maintain a humble demeanor, despite their high levels of competence and skill. </p>

            <!-- Image for Capricorn -->
            <div class="section-box">
                <img src="../img/signs/Capricorn.png" class="zodiac-image">
                <p>Capricorns are the strategists and leaders of the zodiac, with a pragmatic approach that helps them establish and realize long-term goals. Their status and reputation are important to them; they are climbers who are willing to work hard and make sacrifices to achieve their ambitions. A Capricorn's serious exterior often hides a witty and dry sense of humor, and they can be surprisingly fun once they relax.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Overall, Earth signs are the zodiac's anchors, providing a solid foundation upon which the rest of the signs can operate. These signs are considered to be the "builders" of the zodiac, as they are typically focused on creating tangible results and maintaining stability. They are reliable, hardworking, and have a clear sense of realism, which often leads them to success in various endeavors.</p>
